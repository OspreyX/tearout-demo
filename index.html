<p>The OpenFin Runtime makes it possible to 'tear out' elements from an 
application and have them persist in windows on their own. The newly 
created tearout window becomes a child of the application it came from. </p>

<p>When you decide you want to tear out an element, you will need to create 
an OpenFin window to receive the DOM element. This is done with a call to
new fin.desktop.Window. Because there is a cost to creating 
a window, often applications will create a pool of pre-created, empty windows 
and leave them in a hidden state until needed. 
Under the covers, when asked for a new window the OpenFin Javascript adapter 
will call window.open and return a reference to the parent that is wrapped<br>
in an OpenFin Window object. Being an OpenFin window means that the parent is 
able to make OpenFin API calls against it. For example, the parent window can
move, animate, show, hide, minimize, maximize, etc the created child window. </p>

<p>The actual dragging out of the element can be initiated in a number of ways. 
One option (and the one demonstrated here) is to inject the element that is 
to be dragged out into a waiting destination tearout window on click. From here you can
move the new tearout programmatically. Another option is to use native HTML5 drag and 
drop to determine where the drop location will be and on the drop event place 
the tearout window. The only caveat to this method is that once the 
mouse leaves the bounds of the parent window you no longer are able to set 
event.preventDefault() on a dragover event. Unfortunately Windows 
will show the 'not-allowed' cursor even though for our purposes we really can drop 
anywhere. To mitigate this, you can move an OpenFin window, with opacity set to .01, programmatically
to always be behind the mouse. In so doing you are able to have the correct cursor prompt. This is how our chat app handles tearouts. </p>

<p>Applications such as our and d:code:it's MarketStack create a tearout experience without actually moving DOM from one one window to another. Before transferring DOM elements from one window to another, decide if this is the best experience for the user. </p>
